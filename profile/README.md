## Build Enterprise PHP Applications with Clarity and Confidence

**Concept-Labs provides a modern PHP ecosystem that eliminates the complexity of traditional frameworks while maintaining enterprise-grade capabilities.**

> Stop wrestling with magic and hidden conventions. Build applications where every piece of configuration is transparent, every dependency is explicit, and every component is testable.

## Why Concept-Labs Exists

After decades of PHP development experience, our founder [Victor Galitsky](https://github.com/vgalitsky) recognized a fundamental problem: **modern PHP frameworks had become too magical**. Hidden conventions, opaque configurations, and deeply buried dependencies made applications harder to understand, debug, and maintain.

**The Solution:** A philosophy built on three pillars:

1. **üîç Transparency Over Magic** - Every configuration is readable JSON. Every dependency is explicit. No surprises.
2. **üß© Composability Over Monoliths** - Mix and match packages. Each component is self-contained and purposeful.
3. **üöÄ Production-First Design** - Built for long-running processes, high performance, and real-world scale.

This isn't just another framework‚Äîit's a **rethinking of how PHP applications should be built**, distilled from years of enterprise experience into a lean, powerful ecosystem.

## What Makes Concept-Labs Different

### Clear Configuration You Can Actually Read
```json
{
  "@import": [
    "${BASE}/etc/app.json"
  ]
  "app":{
     "name": "myapp"
  }
  "database": {
    "host": "@env(DB_HOST|localhost)",
    "credentials": "@include(etc/redis/credetials.json)"
  },
  "cache": {
    "driver": {
      "@extends": "etc/cache/driver.json",
      "preference": "Acme\\Driver\\RedisInterface"
    },
    "prefix": "#{app.name}"
  }
}
```
No hidden magic. Configuration with powerful directives you can understand at a glance.

### Drop-In Integration
Every package includes a `concept.json` that self-describes its dependencies and configuration. Add a package via Composer, and it just works‚Äîno manual wiring required.

### PSR Standards Throughout
Built on **PSR-7, PSR-11, PSR-14, PSR-15, PSR-17**‚Äîensuring your code is portable, testable, and compatible with the broader PHP ecosystem.

### Built for Scale
Designed from the ground up for long-running processes like RoadRunner and Swoole. Low-overhead middleware, efficient memory management, and clear error boundaries ensure your application performs in production.

## Core Packages

Our ecosystem is built on carefully designed, focused packages:

- **[@Concept-Labs/config](https://github.com/Concept-Labs/config)** - Powerful JSON configuration with environment variables, imports, and references
- **[@Concept-Labs/singularity](https://github.com/Concept-Labs/singularity)** - PSR-11 dependency injection container with explicit preferences
- **[@Concept-Labs/event-dispatcher](https://github.com/Concept-Labs/event-dispatcher)** - PSR-14 event system for decoupled communication
- **[@Concept-Labs/http-message](https://github.com/Concept-Labs/http-message)** - PSR-7 HTTP message implementations
- **[@Concept-Labs/http](https://github.com/Concept-Labs/http)** - Modern HTTP stack with middleware pipeline
- **[@Concept-Labs/simple-http](https://github.com/Concept-Labs/simple-http)** - Quick-start HTTP application template
- **[@Concept-Labs/dbal](https://github.com/Concept-Labs/dbal)** - Database abstraction with fluent query builders
- More coming soon...

Each package is independently useful, yet they work seamlessly together.

## Quick Growth Through Experience

Concept-Labs represents rapid innovation built on a foundation of decades of PHP experience. What typically takes years to mature has been accelerated through:

- **Battle-tested patterns** from enterprise applications
- **Lessons learned** from framework limitations
- **Modern PHP capabilities** (8.2+) enabling cleaner abstractions
- **Focused vision** from experienced architecture

The result? A production-ready ecosystem that feels both familiar and refreshingly modern.

## Philosophy in Practice

> **"An application should be a conversation between its configuration and its code‚Äînot a mystery novel."**  
> ‚Äî The Concept-Labs Philosophy

We believe that:
- **Configuration should tell a story** - Open any config file and understand what the app does
- **Dependencies should be explicit** - No magic resolution or hidden dependencies
- **Packages should self-describe** - Each package brings its own `concept.json`
- **Production comes first** - Long-running processes, memory efficiency, clear error boundaries

This philosophy emerged from real-world pain points: debugging applications where behavior was determined by hidden conventions, tracking down dependencies buried in framework internals, and fighting framework limitations when scaling to production.

Concept-Labs exists to solve these problems. **Build with clarity. Deploy with confidence.**
